# LumiSky_Lamp
This is the repository for the LumiSky weather lamp project made for the Design Thinking and Electronic Prototyping course at Aalto Univeristy. 

This project was developed by Tomasz Luber, Lara Scarafia and Johannes Sempert.

Contents:

  - lamp_main.ino - the main code for the ESP32 controlling the lamp
  - lamp_base.f3d, lamp_ring_shelves.f3d and lamp_shade.f3d - Autodesk Fusion files containing the 3D models of the lamp's body. \nDISCLAIMER!!! The lampshade and the ring shelves don't fit properly in this configuration and had to be sanded down to fit over the smaller NeoPixel ring.
